Anmar is an elderly friendly application designed to allow elder people to enjoy all the positive experiences that an online library can offer to end-users through a consistent navigation system and forms, validated form entries, and multiple defined pages.

A collaborative project of the Advanced Client Side Development module at NCI where a PWA for a specific business was implemented. 
For this purpose, React, information pulled from a remote data source and information stored in local storage, form validation entries and a defined navigation system were implemented.
